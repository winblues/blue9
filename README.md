![alice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc694e3-883c-496b-a151-280e8163cea3)

Blue9 is a modern and lightweight Linux desktop experience with the look of classic Macs. Based on Fedora Atomic Xfce with various OS9 themes and icons.

 If your tastes are more of the Windows variety, try out [Blue95](https://github.com/winblues/blue95).

## Try It Out

> [!NOTE]  
> Live CD is a new feature and is still in testing.

We are now creating a [Live ISO](https://pub-969fbc86b5f24e4d81c6d022e8fd8dde.r2.dev/blue9-live-latest.iso) that can be used to boot into a Blue9 live environment. Test it out without needing to install anything.

## Notes

This is very much a work in progress.
